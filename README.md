AI Concepts and Technologies 🤖
AI Types
- ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence) 🔍: Specific task AI, e.g., Google Maps.
- AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) 💡: Human-like thinking AI, e.g., GenAI for content generation like ChatGPT.

Large Language Models (LLMs)
- LLM 🧠: AI model for natural language processing tasks, such as text generation and translation.
- LLM Architecture 🤖: Multiple layers of neural networks with fine-tunable parameters.

Agentic AI
- Agentic AI 🚀: Autonomous deep learning AI for task completion without human interaction.
- Agent Capabilities 📝: Human-like task implementation, such as booking tickets and sending emails.

OpenAI Agent SDK
- OpenAI Agent SDK 📚: Features like Runners 🏃‍♂️, Agent 🤖, and Agent Loop 🔄 for building autonomous AI agents.

Design Patterns
- Anthropic Design Pattern 📈: Multi-agent design pattern involving:
 - Prompt Chaining 🔗: Task distribution into chunks.
 - Routing 📨: Task assignment to the right agent.
 - Parallelization 🚀: Simultaneous task execution.
 - Orchestrator 👩‍💼: Manager-level agent for task assignment.
 - Optimizer 🔍: Agent for work quality checking and improvement.

Generative AI vs Agentic AI
- Generative AI 🎨: Content generation without action.
- Agentic AI 🚀: Content generation, suggestion, instruction, and task completion.

Query Processing
- Normal Query 🤔: Agent > LLM > Final Output
- Complex Query (Action) 🤖: Prompt > Runner > LLM > Agent Tool > Response from Tool > LLM > Final Output
